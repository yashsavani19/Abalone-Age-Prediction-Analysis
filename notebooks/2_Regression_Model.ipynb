    "- R-Squared is 0.352, meaning about 35.2% of the variation in the Rings is explained by the model\n",
    "- F-Static value is 452.8, with p < 0.001, indicating the significance of the whole model, statistically\n",
    "- Kurtosis being 6.92, and Skew being 1.62, shows that the residuals may not be perfectly normal, but with this large sample size, it isn't too critical\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coefficients\n",
    "Baseline (`Females`)\n",
    "- `Intercept` = `9.1216`\n",
    "- `Slope` = `1.921`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Infants` (I)\n",
    "- `Intercept` = Baseline + Baseline Shift (C(Sex)[T.I]) = 9.1216 - 3.8558 = `5.2658`\n",
    "- `Slope` = Baseline Slope + (C(Sex)[T.I]:Whole weight = 4.1720) = 1.9201 + 4.1720 = `6.0921`\n",
    "    Infants gain about 6.09 rings for each 1-unit increase in whole weight, significantly higher than females\n",
    "\n",
    "`Males` (I)\n",
    "- `Intercept` = Baseline + Baseline Shift (C(Sex)[T.M]) = 9.1216 - 0.7999 = `8.3217`\n",
    "- `Slope` = Baseline Slope + (C(Sex)[T.M]:Whole weight = 0.4866) = 1.9201 + 0.4866 = `2.4067`\n",
    "    Infants gain about 6.09 rings for each 1-unit increase in whole weight, significantly higher than females\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance\n",
    "- p-values of all the terms (main effects and interactions) is less than 0.05 (p < 0.05), meaning that they are stastically significant\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "- As we can see, sex matters. This is because both Intercept Rings and Slopes differ significantly.\n",
    "- Whole Weight is a strong predictor. This is because Higher whole weight generally correlates with more rings, but the efect   size varies accross sex categories.\n",
    "- There is rapid growth or increase in the rings for Infants. This is because there is much steeper slope for Infants, indicating a rapid increase in rings as weight increases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Overall, this regression model explains about 35% of the variation in Rings, indicating that both Sex and Whole weight, along with their interaction, play a significant role in predicting abalone age. Infants begin with a lower baseline number of Rings but show a steep increase in Rings as Whole weight grows, while Males have a moderate slope and Females have the lowest slope but the highest baseline. All coefficients are statistically significant, showing the importance of including Sex and its interaction with Whole weight when modeling Rings."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiple regression model fits the data reasonably well, explaining around 54% of the variation in abalone age. Key predictors such as `Height`, `Diameter`, and `Whole Weight` showed strong  relationships with age, aligning with the findings from earlier exploration. However, not all results were accurate. Some predictors like `Length`, `Shucked Weight`, and `Viscera Weight` had **negative or unexpected coefficients**. This is likely due to **multicollinearity**, where predictors are highly correlated with each other, which makes it **difficult for the model to accurately isolate their individual effects**. We also found that males only had 0.554 rings more than the `Females`, which is not statistically significant. This is a much different observation compared to the earlier model (*Fitting Model using `Sex` and `Whole Weight`*), where we found significant difference in slopes and intercepts. This means that when other physical measurements are included (e.g Length, Diameter, etc), **sex of the abalone adds little additional predictive value**, and `Males` and `Females` **would have similar predicted rings**\n",
